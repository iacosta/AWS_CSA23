### AWS Cloud Disaster Recovery Scenarios

The AWS Cloud offers a range of disaster recovery (DR) approaches, providing quick and reliable recovery options for IT systems. These scenarios are arranged based on the speed at which a system can be available to users after a disaster event:

1. **Backup and Restore**
   - Simple and cost-effective approach.
   - Back up data and applications to the AWS Cloud for recovery.
   - No use of conventional tape backups.
   - Amazon EC2 instances are utilized for testing as needed.
   - Low storage costs with Amazon S3 (as low as $0.015/GB for infrequent access).

2. **Pilot Light**
   - Analogy from gas heating: a small flame ignites the entire furnace quickly.
   - Replicate a portion of your IT structure for core services.
   - AWS Cloud takes over seamlessly during a disaster.
   - Critical core elements must already be configured and running in AWS.
   - Rapidly provision a full-scale production environment around the critical core during recovery.

3. **Warm Standby**
   - A scaled-down version of a fully functional environment is always running in the cloud.
   - Extends the pilot light approach and decreases recovery time.
   - Some services are always running, improving readiness for recovery.
   - Identify and fully duplicate business-critical systems on AWS.

4. **Multi-site**
